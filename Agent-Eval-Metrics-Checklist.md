# ✅ Checklist: What Should I Measure for AI Agents?

_Use this as a guide when building metrics for agentic systems—because “it worked” isn’t a metric._

---

## 🧩 Start with Key Metrics
- [ ] What outcome matters most to *your* use case?
- [ ] Are you measuring both success and *quality* of that success?

> 💡 _Example: A “supplier compliance check” succeeded — but did it follow the right decision path?_

---

## 📉 Establish Baselines
- [ ] Do you have a baseline for current agent performance?
- [ ] Can you compare new agent versions or workflows against it?

> 💡 _Don’t fly blind—baseline weirdness before you optimize it._

---

## 📈 Track Trends Over Time
- [ ] Are agent behaviors improving, degrading, or just getting weirder?
- [ ] Are you logging trace-level data for comparison?

> 💡 _It’s not just **what** the agent does, but **how consistently** it does it._

---

## 🔗 Combine Multiple Metrics
- [ ] Are you layering traditional metrics with behavioral ones?
- [ ] Can you tell *why* a success or failure happened?

> 💡 _Example: Completion rate ↑ but average tool calls per task ↑↑ = inefficiency._

---

## 🚦 Set Thresholds
- [ ] What’s “good enough” for your use case?
- [ ] Where’s your red/yellow/green zone?

> 💡 _Set thresholds not just for output, but also for steps taken, calls made, and user trust impact._
